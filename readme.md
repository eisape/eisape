I am a PhD student in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/) and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab ([CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)) at MIT. I'm advised by [Roger Levy](http://cpl.mit.edu/people.html) and [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/).

I use machine learning and NLP to model human language processing. My work is supported by an [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am also the student representative to the board of the [Cognitive Science Society](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/) and have spent time at [Google Research](https://research.google/) and the Fundamental AI Research team ([FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/)) at Meta AI.
