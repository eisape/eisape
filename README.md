I am a PhD student in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/) and the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT. I'm advised by [Roger Levy](http://cpl.mit.edu/people.html) and [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/).

I use machine learning and NLP to model human language processing. My work is supported by an [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [GEM Full fellowship](https://gemfellowship.org/). I am also the student representative to the [board of the Cognitive Science Society](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/) and a student researcher at Google AI.
