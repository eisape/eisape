I am a PhD student in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/) and the [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://www.csail.mit.edu/) at MIT, advised by [Roger Levy](http://cpl.mit.edu/people.html) and [Yoon Kim](https://people.csail.mit.edu/yoonkim/).

My research involves using machine learning and NLP to model human language processing. This work is supported by an [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [GEM Full fellowship](https://gemfellowship.org/).
